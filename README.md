# Cybersecurity Lab â€“ Password Cracking Project

This project is part of my Introduction to Cyber Threats class. I used a virtual lab to learn how password cracking works and why weak passwords are dangerous.

## What I Did

- Created a password file using `htpasswd` for fake users like alice and bob
- Tried a dictionary attack using a Python script to crack the password
- Wrote my thoughts about password safety and how to protect better

## What I Learned

- How password hashing (SHA1) works
- How hackers use weak passwords to get access
- Why we should use strong and unique passwords

## Tools I Used

- Labtainer virtual machine
- Linux terminal
- Python script (`crackPre.py`)
